# Lab-Test Service Migration Summary

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### Entity Structure Updates
- **FastqFile entity**: Added `sessionId`, `createdBy`, and relationships back to support the workflow
- **FastqFilePair entity**: Manages workflow status and pairs two FastqFile entities
- **Updated imports**: Fixed imports to use `FastqFilePairResponseDto` and correct enum locations

### Service Method Updates
- **mapFastqFilePairToDto()**: New method to convert FastqFilePair entities to DTOs
- **findAllSession()**: Updated to work with FastqFilePair entities instead of individual FastqFile entities
- **findSessionById()**: Updated to load and return FastqFilePair data
- **uploadFastQ()**: Simplified to create individual FastqFile entities (no status management)
- **deleteFastQ()**: Updated to check if file is part of a pair before allowing deletion
- **sendFastqToAnalysis()**: Deprecated in favor of pair-based workflow

### New Methods Added
- **createFastqFilePair()**: Creates a FastqFilePair from two FastqFile entities
- **sendFastqPairToAnalysis()**: Sends a complete FastqFilePair to analysis with proper status management

## üîÑ New Workflow

### File Upload Process
1. Individual FastqFile entities are uploaded via `uploadFastQ()`
2. Two FastqFile entities are paired using `createFastqFilePair()`
3. The FastqFilePair is sent to analysis using `sendFastqPairToAnalysis()`

### Status Management
- Individual FastqFile entities have no status
- All workflow status is managed on FastqFilePair entities
- Status values: UPLOADED ‚Üí WAIT_FOR_APPROVAL ‚Üí APPROVED/REJECTED

## üîó Integration Points

### With Analysis Service
- Analysis service works with FastqFilePair entities
- Controller endpoints updated to use `fastqFilePairId` parameters
- Status operations (approve/reject) work on FastqFilePair level

### DTOs Updated
- `FastqFileResponseDto`: Simple file information only
- `FastqFilePairResponseDto`: Complete workflow information including both R1 and R2 files
- Response DTOs updated to use FastqFilePair structure

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Add Controller Endpoints**: Create new endpoints for:
   - `POST /sessions/:sessionId/fastq-pairs` - Create FastqFilePair
   - `POST /fastq-pairs/:pairId/send-to-analysis` - Send pair to analysis

2. **Update Frontend**: Update UI to work with the new pair-based workflow

3. **Database Migration**: Ensure database schema matches the new entity structure

4. **Testing**: Test the complete workflow from upload ‚Üí pairing ‚Üí analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `sendFastqToAnalysis()` method is deprecated
- Individual FastqFile entities can no longer be sent directly to analysis
- Must create FastqFilePair first, then send pair to analysis
- Response DTOs have changed structure to include pair information

The lab-test service now successfully compiles and provides a proper foundation for the new FastqFile/FastqFilePair workflow!
